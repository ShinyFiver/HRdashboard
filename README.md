# HRdashboard
This is a side project that i do to try data visualization stuff. This is a dashboard made from Real World Fake Dataset and i decided to pick human resource from it.
I have to convert the CSV file first, then do some data manipulation to make it more appealing in dashboard. Using different chart and slicer to make it more dynamic, i can make the dashboard interactive to make it change based on selected slicer. I like when the graph is interactive, so i decided this one must be an interactive as well.

I attach my xlsx file format in here, because when i try to upload it in google sheet, it ruined the dashboard formation. I just hate it when that happens.

Here's the link of the dataset: https://data.world/markbradbourne/rwfd-real-world-fake-data/workspace/file?filename=Human+Resources.csv

This is some snippet of dashboard:
